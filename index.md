# Professional Assessment

My name is Ethan Anderson. I am a Computer Science student at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), graduating in May 2025.

Completing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at SNHU has helped me to mature into a confident and capable developer. This portfolio is a way for me to showcase my technical skills, my creative side, and demonstrate that I am ready to take on real-world projects. Throughout the program, I have developed a wide range of technical skills and have come to understand what excites me most in the world of software engineering.  I have learned that I am most passionate about taking ideas and creating unique ways to bring them to life, whether that is by writing code, designing new programs, or troubleshooting in existing areas. 

While developing the enhancements for my Capstone project, I gained a deeper understanding of software engineering and design, data structures and algorithms, databases, and how all these concepts come together to create a functional and useful 3D graphics application. Furthermore, I utilized industry-standard third-party libraries such as ImGui, Assimp, and nlohmann JSON, to demonstrate my ability to implement realistic and user-friendly software solutions that I will continue to encounter throughout my career. These enhancements pushed me to apply foundational software engineering concepts such as building modular, readable, maintainable, scalable, secure, and user-focused software that solves difficult problems, and creates meaningful value.

Throughout my time at SNHU, I have taken the initiative to explore the broader world of computer science and its overlap within applied math and science. That curiosity led me to discover my passion for graphics programming, game development, and web development, where technical skills and creativity meet. The knowledge and experience I have gained during this degree will continue to shape my learning and growth while I move out into the world.

Outside of school, I led a development team on a real-world web application for a company that had a brilliant idea for a software application that could help thousands improve their communities and lives. I also participated in a Game Jam where I built a 3D horror game  that I created, called We See Shadows, using the Godot engine. These experiences helped me advance my skillset in areas like team collaboration, product development, agile methodologies, communicating with non-technical audiences, managing project scope, and ensuring project deliverables and timelines were met within client expectations.

This portfolio will continue to expand as I move through my career, as well as my personal goals of designing and developing my own products. It represents not only the work I have completed during my time at SNHU but also the foundation that gives me a solid jump into my future as a developer and creator.
