Hello! My name is Ethan Anderson. I am a Computer Science student at Southern New Hampshire University, graduating in April of 2025.

My passions lie in graphics programming, game engines/development, and real-time rendering. Currently, I am working part-time as a lead developer on a full-stack web application.

This page is in progress while I work hard on my capstone project. My github account is linked at the top. It showcases all of the work I have accomplished so far. 

If there are more projects you would like to see I can privately share the code. ðŸ‘€

All the best!
