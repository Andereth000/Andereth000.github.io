Hello! My name is Ethan Anderson. I am a **Computer Science student** at Southern New Hampshire University, graduating in April of 2025.

My passions lie in **graphics programming**, **game engines/development**, and **real-time rendering**. Currently, I am working part-time as a **lead developer** on a **full-stack web application**.

This page is temporarily empty while I work hard on my capstone project. There is a button at the top of the page which links to my github account. Feel free to check out those repositories in the meantime.

If there are more projects you would like to see I can privately share the code. ðŸ‘€

All the best!

-Ethan Anderson
